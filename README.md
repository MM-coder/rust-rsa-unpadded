# Simple RSA Implementation in Rust

> This repository contains a simple RSA implementation in Rust indended to demonstrate how RSA works. 

# Installation and Running

This guide assumes you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If you do not have Rust installed, please visit [The Rust Programming Language website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust and Cargo before proceeding.

## Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open a terminal and run the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MM-coder/rust-rsa-unpadded

After cloning, navigate into the project's directory:

```bash

cd rust-rsa-unpadded

```

## Running with Cargo

Cargo is the Rust package manager and build tool that makes it easy to compile and run Rust projects.

To compile and run the program in one step, use the following command:

```bash

cargo run .

```

Replace arg1 arg2 with the actual arguments your program expects.
Building for Release

If you want to compile the program for release, you can use:

```bash

cargo build --release

```

This will compile the program with optimizations. The compiled binary will be located in target/release/ instead of target/debug/.
